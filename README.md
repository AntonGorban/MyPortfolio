Small, responsive, one-page portfolio site for a beginner layout designer.

> This is not my portfolio, but just a layout.

## Layout

The layout is represented by the `psd` file at [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cpWka1DdL79T2ju77c8zyUse_3raa35D/view?usp=sharing) and the `png` file.

## Technology

Layout is done without using preprocessors, in `HTML` and `CSS`.

Responsiveness is designed with `media queries`.

The positioning of the elements is done using `float`.
